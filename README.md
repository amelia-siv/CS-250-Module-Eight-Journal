# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Understanding user needs means stepping into the user’s shoes to really get what they want from the program. Creating user stories helps by breaking down those needs into simple, clear statements from the user’s perspective. This keeps development focused on solving actual problems and building features that matter, rather than guessing or assuming what’s needed.

# How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When I develop programs, I like to work in small chunks and get feedback early and often. Agile methods like Sprints, Daily Scrums, and Retrospectives help keep the work organized and flexible. This way, I can adjust quickly if something changes or new info comes up, making the whole process more efficient and less stressful.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member is about more than just doing your own work well. It means communicating clearly, helping others when needed, and being open to feedback. Good teamwork keeps everyone moving forward together, and makes sure the project succeeds because no one can do it alone.
